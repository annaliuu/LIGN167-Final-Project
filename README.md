# LIGN 167 Final Project
## Project Description
This is a dynamic question bank for LIGN 101. It separates the course material into the main topics outlined in the LIGN 101 syllabus by Will Styler. 
Students will be able to pick which topic they want to practice by selecting a custom topic from the dropdown menu. Once a topic is chosen, the student can
click the "Generate Question" button, which then generates a question about the selected topic. Once the question and answer choices load, the student will
be able to type in their answer to the multiple choice question (in the form of "A", "B", "C", or "D"). Once the answer choice is processed, the question
bank will output correct or incorrect, and if the answer is incorrect, it will provide the correct answer choice as well as an explanation of the correct
answer. The student can then choose to generate another question about that same topic, or move on to select a different topic from the dropdown menu.
